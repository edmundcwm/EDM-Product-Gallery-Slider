# EDM Product Gallery Slider

A WooCommerce extended plugin that transforms the default Single product gallery into a slider.

By default, WooCommerce Single Product Thumbnails are stacked on top of each other. This plugin changes that behavior by converting the thumbnails into a Slick Slider carousel.
